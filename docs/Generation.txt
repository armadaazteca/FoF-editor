Editor fields / attributes for items.otb and various .xml files generation: 

items.otb
=========
group - can be either 'Ground', 'Container', 'Fluid', 'Splash', 'Other' or 'Deprecated'.
Not sure it has some serious meaningful for RME, but at least isGroundTile() used in several places, so better to include it.
Suggest using 'Ground' group by default for those items which have 'isFullGround' attribute, 'Other' group otherwise.

items.xml
=========
id - item id obviously
* sometimes there is 'toid' and 'fromid' instead of single id, looks like it's for merging several items into one

article - either 'a' or 'an', 'a' is default
name - string name of the item

* there is also set of nested attribute elements, not sure all of them are needed for now, but at least we'll need
<attribute key="floorchange" value="down | up" />
for ladders / holes.
Also there is 'description' attribute that may be useful in some cases.

<attribute key="decayTo" value="483" />
does look like it's for one item transforming into another and 'duration' attribute may be something like transform time.

Also it may make sense to write
<attribute key="blockprojectile" value="1" />
If corresponding .dat attribute is set. 

creatures.xml
=============
name - string name of the creature
type - mostly 'monster', don't even know whether there will be other types of creature, NPCs maybe.
looktype - id of the creature
lookhead, lookbody etc. is probably for changing so-called 'outfit', looks like it's some colors of cloths etc.

materials.xml
=============
Would suggest to write it statically. It actually should just declare inclusion of other useful files:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<materials>
	<include file="borders.xml"/>
	<include file="grounds.xml"/>
	<include file="walls.xml"/>
	<include file="doodads.xml"/>
	<include file="tilesets.xml"/>
</materials>
