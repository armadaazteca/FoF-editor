- context menu for object sprite list to delete or export into png 
- wheel-scrolling for objects listbox (works in Windows now, but doesn't work in Linux)

Future work:
- update help and quick guide according to latest modifications
- think of how to handle light color attribute properly
- undo / redo functions
- possibility to export particular 32x32 sprites or full composed picture into png
- possibly add menu item to clean-up unused sprites
- possibly autosave or auto-backup feature
