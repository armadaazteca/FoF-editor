- don't forget about 'always animated' checkbox
- validate image file types when importing sprites
- validate imported sprite dimensions
- warning message box when closing editor with unsaved changes
- wheel-scrolling for objects listbox

Future work:
- support for separate layer editing, field for layers number, checkbox for 'blend layers'
- think of how to handle light color attribute properly
- some bug when increasing object width or height and then decreasing again
- possibility to export particular 32x32 sprites or full composed picture into png
- possibly add menu item to clean-up unused sprites
- items.otb generation
