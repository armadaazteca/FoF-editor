For v1.0:
- update 'Quick guide', describe 'blocking' states
- signature validation
- implement 'blocking' sprites toggle for all frames on animation
- verify current object for all undo / redo operations

Minor bugs:
- get rid of all memory leaks (detected in VS, particularly with JSON stuff)
- wheel-scrolling for objects listbox (works in Windows now, but doesn't work in Linux)

Really future work:
- possibly export whole animation in .gif or other format
