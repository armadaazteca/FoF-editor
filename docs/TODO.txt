For v1.0:
- think of how to handle light color attribute properly
- undo / redo functions (attributes toggling, value attributes changes, object creation / deletion, sprites dragging / deletion, advanced attributes changes)
- auto-backup
- signature validation

Minor bugs:
- get rid of all memory leaks (detected in VS, particularly with JSON stuff)
- solve incorrect layers blending on transparent areas
- wheel-scrolling for objects listbox (works in Windows now, but doesn't work in Linux)

Really future work:
- possibly export whole animation in .gif or other format
