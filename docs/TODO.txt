Current:
- for advanced attributes make 'floor change' to have 'north', 'south' etc. values
- think about adding 'always on top' / 'always on bottom' attributes

Optional features:
- go to object by ID

Minor bugs:
- get rid of all memory leaks (detected in VS, particularly with JSON stuff)
- wheel-scrolling for objects listbox (works in Windows now, but doesn't work in Linux)
